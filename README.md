# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this repository is to help the PlanMyTrip app provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels. We did this using API's from OpenWeatherMap and Google. 
The code for the project was written in Python (Jupyter Notebook). 
We ask the client for their preferences and based on that, then, with the program created, we narrowed the options to hotels that were within a given range of latitude and longitude and that provided the right kind of weather for the client. In the end the client will receive an ideal itinerary proposal.
